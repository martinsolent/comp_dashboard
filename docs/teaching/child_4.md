# Teaching - Study Guide

![Study](ACS_slides/study-1265859_1920.jpg)



This Study Guide is aimed at first year (Level 4) undergraduates who are undertaking the Digital Creativity COM420 module which involves a coursework task to produce a design artefact and an accompanying report which documents the research, design and implementation.

Although some of the advice will also be useful for other units and levels of study. Remember report structure and requirements will vary on different units, always make sure you ask your tutor what is the appropriate structure before submission.
