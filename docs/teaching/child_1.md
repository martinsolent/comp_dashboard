## Best Practice in Teaching and Learning Design

This course will guide you through three phases of module development:

* Module conceptualisation
* Designing and delivering content
* Assessment, feedback and reflection

Within each phase, we will explore the best practices in developing and delivering module content, including strategies for encouraging higher-level engagement among students.  All of the strategies discussed will allow for both fully online and mixed face-to-face and online delivery.
