They are all registered and have done the training with Nick undertaking 3 invigilators already (at 30/6/2021)


### Organisation of exam session & individuation

With Covid regulations and visualisation will be taking place online and the invigilator requires the candidates to have the WebCam switched on. No need for Screen Sharing and a group of candidates can be invigilator at one time.

**Each of the exam lasts 1 hour** - although students usually only take** 40 to 45 minutes.**

They do need to **download software from the BCS** to their computer which means that using their own personal computer is advised as they may not have admin rights to their work laptops.

**They will be invited to the team session 15 minutes** before the test starts this will give time to set everything up including them downloading software and also the invigilator authorising them to take the test.

If they start late - don't worry as the hour slot only starts once they commence the test

The following [BCS videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NP5zjatpkQ&ab_channel=BCS%2CTheCharteredInstituteforIT) guide through the processes the manager/superuser needs to add tutors, invigilators, set up exam sessions and add candidates.
